= netzke-persistence

Development of netzke-persistence has been suspended and its functionality by bigger part became obsolete. Currently, Netzke Core implements the default state management using sessions, which is good enough for many use cases. The future (vague) plans for this gem are to enable user/role-based persistence for Netzke components.
